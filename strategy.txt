CodinGame Fall Challenge 2020

Strategy

To consider
	* Most rupees
		* Urgency bonus
	* Spells 
		* Repeatable
	* Tome spells
		* Gained tax
		* Spent tax learning ahead
		* Oppo learning tome spell before us
	* Disappearing orders
		* Oppo completing order before us
	* Optimized resting

1) Speed
	* Build 6 pots as fast as possible
		* Given a set of orders, return the number of turns it'd take for each order.
			* NEW: consider tome spells
				* Don't wanna overflow inventory
				* Can't predict tome spells well since oppo can take it
		* Choose the fastest order each time
2) Efficent High Score
	* Build pots that give the most pots
3) Combo
	* Compare action path scores for fastest vs highest value

Pre tome read
	* Purely for testing and powering our post tome read algo
	* Only tome index 0 checks (no tax)
		* isNoIngredientCost()
		* isHighTier0Earned()
			* Maybe after isNoIngredientCost
		* doesCreatedHighTieredIngredients()
			* Maybe not worth for investigation

Post tome read
	* TBD based on pre-tome read data

TODO
	* Spell casting should compare spells to ensure best pick
		* E.g Spell(4, 0, 0, 0) vs Spell(2, 0, 0, 0)
		* E.g. we don't cause overflow




Avoiding timeouts:
    * Try using a queue instead of stack for BFS and shortcircuiting after processing the first layer of nodes that results in an action path
    * Limit best spells to top N (2 or 3?), based off weight of missing ingredients after simulating spell cast (can break ties on inventory total weight)
