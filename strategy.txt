CodinGame Fall Challenge 2020

Strategy

To consider
	* Most rupees
	* Spells 
	* Disappearing orders

1) Speed
	* Build 3 pots as fast as possible
		* Given a set of orders, return the number of turns it'd take for each order.
			* Witch method
				* getActionsPerOrder(orders) 
					* -> { id: { "actions" : [] } }
					* pick least actions with highest price
				* actionsToGetIngredient(ingredient)
					* Given an ingredient, return all possible action paths that can lead to that ingredient and return the resulting inventory
					* -> [
						{actions: [], resultingInventory: []}, 
						{actions: [], resultingInventory: []}, 
						...
						] 
					or None (not possible)
				* actionsToGetInventory(minInventory: [1,2,4,0])
					* given a minimum required inventory, return all action paths that can lead to that inventory and resulting inventory
					* -> [
						{actions: [], resultingInventory: []}, 
						{actions: [], resultingInventory: []}, 
						...
						]
					or None (not possible)
					* Future: think about how to minimize losses in spells and inventory. Trade off between speed in building a single order and impact on future orders.
				* chooseActionPath([ {actions} ])
					* Given a set of action paths, return the best action path
					* -> {actions: [], resultingInventory: []}
		* Choose the fastest order each time
2) Efficent High Score
	* Build pots that give the most pots
